# Spotify_ETL_Pipeline_on_AWS-Python-

This project implements a serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to ingest and analyze data from the Spotify API using AWS cloud services.
Complete Data Pipeline Data Engineering Project using Spotify

Integrating with Spotify API and extracting Data
Deploying code on AWS Lambda for Data Extraction
Adding trigger to run the extraction automatically
Writing transformation function
Building automated trigger on transformation function
Store files on S3 properly
Building Analytics Tables on data files using Glue and Athena

## üìå Overview

The ETL pipeline extracts music data from the Spotify API, transforms the raw data, and loads it into AWS Athena for analytics using the following services:

- **Amazon CloudWatch** for daily triggers
- **AWS Lambda** for extraction and transformation
- **Amazon S3** for raw and transformed data storage
- **AWS Glue** for schema inference and data cataloging
- **Amazon Athena** for querying and analysis

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components Breakdown

### üîπ Extract

- **Trigger**: Amazon CloudWatch triggers the ETL process daily.
- **Lambda Function**: Python script connects to the **Spotify API** to extract data.
- **Raw Data Storage**: Extracted JSON/CSV is stored in **Amazon S3 (raw)**.

### üîπ Transform

- **Trigger**: Object creation in S3 triggers another Lambda function.
- **Lambda Function**: Transforms raw Spotify data into a structured format (e.g., flattening nested JSON).
- **Transformed Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in **Amazon S3 (transformed)**.

### üîπ Load

- **AWS Glue Crawler**: Scans the transformed S3 bucket to infer schema and update the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.
- **Amazon Athena**: Enables SQL queries on Spotify data using the cataloged schema.
